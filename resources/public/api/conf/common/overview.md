This API allows developers to:
* list and retrieve state benefits
* create, amend or delete customer added state benefits
* create or amend benefits financial data
* mark a state benefit as ignored

Amendments to customer added state benefit or HMRC held state benefit must be made after the tax year has ended.

Amendments to Job Seekers Allowance (JSA) or Employment Support Allowance (ESA) may be made at any time.
For information on how to connect to this API [see the Income Tax MTD end-to-end service guide] (https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/).
